# opencharity
Drupal 7 theme for Opencharity, created as a technical assessment task for Compucorp by Enyi Aja Victor.

  As my first foray into Drupal theme development, after research, I got to work on installing Drupal and setting up the file structure for my theme. I then created the necessary files for the theme (Assessment.info, html.tpl.php, page.tpl.php, style.css, assessment.js)
  My solution includes features such as the login form displayed above the header only to visitors of the site, enabling such a person to either present a valid login and password to gain access to the administrative feaatures of the site or create a new account without administrative privileges. It also includes a Javascript function that performs a slideshow of the various members' logos. The theme has been designed to be responsive to mobile devices, modelled after OpenCharity's mobile website in the resizing and repositioning of elements. 
  The theme has been designed to allow for easy editing of content by the administrator through the Drupal User Interface once said administrator is logged in.
  I attempted to obtain the fonts used in the PSD file that described the theme to be designed, but I was only able to get one to work (OpenSans).
